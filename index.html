This example gallery contains proof-of-principle examples showcasing how [calculations of the shape of data using Bayesian inference](https://bayes-shape-calc.github.io) can be utilized in multiple techniques in the physical sciences.

These examples are just that... examples. The code and concepts are preliminary. They're not yet meant to be stand-alone, robust solutions. They must be developed further for future projects which deal with real experimental systems. In the meantime, the code for these examples are freely available for use. If these examples, and the associated code, is useful in your research project, please cite:
