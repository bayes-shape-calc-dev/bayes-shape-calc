This example gallery contains proof-of-principle examples showcasing how [calculations of the shape of data using Bayesian inference](https://bayes-shape-calc.github.io) can 
be utilized in techniques throughout the physical and life sciences. 

These implementations focus on "toy problems" that mimic real experimental systems. Their purpose is not to provide robust solutions, but rather to demonstrate
the breadth and simplicity of the Bayesian shape calcuation method. While the code and concepts displayed here are currently preliminary, we hope to 
develop them into stand-alone solutions in the future. In the meantime, the code for these examples is freely available for use.
